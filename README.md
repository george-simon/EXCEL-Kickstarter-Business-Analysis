# EXCEL: Kickstarter Business Analysis

### Background
Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome. 
Using the Excel table provided, modify and analyze the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects as you attempt to uncover some market trends.

### Challenge Goals
* Use excel 'formulas' to uncover, split, and analyze dataset
* Create 'pivot tables' to display data
* Utilize 'conditional formatting' in highlighting insights.

### Data Insights
Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter
campaigns?
1. There is a large volume of projects that have been started in the categories of
Music, Theater, and film &amp; Video on Kickstarter. The majority subcategory being
plays.
1. Overall, the quantity of successful projects is greater than both failed and
cancelled projects combined.
1. It looks to be that there have not been many successful kick starters that were
categorized in Food, Games, and Publishing
1. The most successful Category has been music. Particularly in the Rock sub-
category.

What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. Not able to visually see trends of the categories over time.
1. You have to manual filter to follow a hunch or assumption in the various pivot
tables.
1. The ability to investigate the ‘why’ behind trends over time is limited by the
dataset provided. For example, why do projects created in the month of February
see a spike in success and a drop in failed states?

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Scatter Plot – could show possible trends in the categories of the states of projects
1. Box and Whisker plot – could help drill down and see outliers and the ranges of
the different states of the projects.
